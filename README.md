# Simple-Website
A simple website designed to show the separation between .js, .html, and .css file and how the three work together to form one functional website.
I created a project directory and the files to build a website.
I created a heading and other page elements, then linked to external files and tested the page in a browser.
I applied styles to different elements and tested your site in the browser and added support for themes using CSS.
I added JavaScript to enable custom interaction with the page and switching between themes.
I learned how to create and use console messages to peek inside your code.
